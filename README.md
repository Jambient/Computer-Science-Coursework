## Introduction

`Qearn` is my coursework project I made for my computer science A-level. The project is a website that gives teachers a way to test their students with a fun quiz while also allowing them to improve on their skills. After each quiz the teacher can review every students results, see what they got correct and what they got wrong. They can then use this to adjust what they teach or what they test in the next quiz. If a teacher can't find a quiz that is right for them, they can use the quiz building tool to create one from scratch.
